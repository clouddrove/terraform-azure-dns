We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-dns/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "dns_zone" {
   depends_on                   = [module.resource_group, module.vnet]
   source                       = "clouddrove/dns/azure"
   label_order                  = ["name", "environment"]
   name                         = "app"
   environment                  = "test"
   resource_group_name          = module.resource_group.resource_group_name
   enabled_dns                  = true
   dns_zone_names               = "example.com"
   private_registration_enabled = false
   private_dns                  = false
   private_dns_zone_name        = ""
   virtual_network_id           = module.vnet.vnet_id
   a_records = [{
     name    = "test"
     ttl     =  3600
     records = ["10.0.180.17","10.0.180.18"]
    },
    {
     name    = "test2"
     ttl     =  3600
     records = ["10.0.180.17","10.0.180.18"]
    }]
   cname_records =  [{
     name   = "test1"
     ttl    = 3600
     record = "example.com"
    }]

   ns_records = [{
     name = "test2"
     ttl  = 3600
     records = ["ns1.example.com.","ns2.example.com."]
    }]
  }

  ```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
